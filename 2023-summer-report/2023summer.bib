	abstract = {{ABSTRACT} We present the results of a high angular resolution (0.3 ≈ 40 {AU}) Submillimeter Array survey of the 345 {GHz} (870 μm) thermal continuum emission from nine of the brightest, and therefore most massive, circumstellar disks in the ∼1 Myr-old Ophiuchus star-forming region. Using two-dimensional radiative transfer calculations, we simultaneously ﬁt the observed continuum visibilities and broadband spectral energy distribution for each disk with a parametric structure model. Compared to previous millimeter studies, this survey includes signiﬁcant upgrades in modeling, data quality, and angular resolution that provide improved constraints on key structure parameters, particularly those that characterize the spatial distribution of mass in the disks. In the context of a surface density proﬁle motivated by similarity solutions for viscous accretion disks, Σ ∝ (R/Rc)−γ exp [−(R/Rc)2−γ ], the bestﬁt models for the sample disks have characteristic radii Rc ≈ 20–200 {AU}, high disk masses Md ≈ 0.005–0.14 M (a sample selection bias), and a narrow range of radial Σ gradients (γ ≈ 0.4–1.0) around a median γ = 0.9. These density structures are used in conjunction with accretion rate estimates from the literature to help characterize the viscous evolution of the disk material. Using the standard prescription for disk viscosities, those combined constraints indicate that α ≈ 0.0005–0.08. Three of the sample disks show large (R ≈ 20–40 {AU}) central cavities in their continuum emission morphologies, marking extensive zones where dust has been physically removed and/or has signiﬁcantly diminished opacities. Based on the current requirements of planet formation models, these emission cavities and the structure constraints for the sample as a whole suggest that these young disks may eventually produce planetary systems, and have perhaps already started.},

	abstract = {We describe a general radiative equilibrium and temperature correction procedure for use in Monte Carlo radiation transfer codes with sources of temperature-independent opacity, such as astrophysical dust. The technique utilizes the fact that Monte Carlo simulations track individual photon packets, so we may easily determine where their energy is absorbed. When a packet is absorbed, it heats a particular cell within the envelope, raising its temperature. To enforce radiative equilibrium, the absorbed packet is immediately reemitted. To correct the cell temperature, the frequency of the reemitted packet is chosen so that it corrects the temperature of the spectrum previously emitted by the cell. The reemitted packet then continues being scattered, absorbed, and reemitted until it finally escapes from the envelope. As the simulation runs, the envelope heats up, and the emergent spectral energy distribution ({SED}) relaxes to its equilibrium value without iteration. This implies that the equilibrium temperature calculation requires no more computation time than the {SED} calculation of an equivalent pure scattering model with fixed temperature. In addition to avoiding iteration, our method conserves energy exactly because all injected photon packets eventually escape. Furthermore, individual packets transport energy across the entire system because they are never destroyed. This long-range communication, coupled with the lack of iteration, implies that our method does not suffer the convergence problems commonly associated with Λ-iteration. To verify our temperature correction procedure, we compare our results with standard benchmark tests, and finally we present the results of simulations for two-dimensional axisymmetric density structures.},

	abstract = {Water vapor has been detected in protoplanetary disks. In this work, we model the distribution of water vapor in protoplanetary disks with a thermo-chemical code. For a set of parameterized disk models, we calculate the distribution of dust temperature and radiation ﬁeld of the disk with a Monte Carlo method, and then solve the gas temperature distribution and chemical composition. The radiative transfer includes detailed treatment of scattering by atomic hydrogen and absorption by water of Lyα photons, since the Lyα line dominates the {UV} spectrum of accreting young stars. In a ﬁducial model, we ﬁnd that warm water vapor with temperature around 300 K is mainly distributed in a small and well-conﬁned region in the inner disk. The inner boundary of the warm water region is where the shielding of {UV} ﬁeld due to dust and water itself become signiﬁcant. The outer boundary is where the dust temperature drops below the water condensation temperature. A more luminous central star leads to a more extended distribution of warm water vapor, while dust growth and settling tends to reduce the amount of warm water vapor. Based on typical assumptions regarding the elemental oxygen abundance and the water chemistry, the column density of warm water vapor can be as high as 1022 cm−2. A small amount of hot water vapor with temperature higher than ∼300 K exists in a more extended region in the upper atmosphere of the disk. Cold water vapor with temperature lower than 100 K is distributed over the entire disk, produced by photodesorption of the water ice.},

The chemical compositions of these planet-forming disks regulate all aspects of planetary compositions from bulk elemental inventories to access to water and reactive organics, i.e. a planet’s hospitality to life and its chemical origins. Disk chemical structures are in their turn governed by a combination of in situ chemical processes, and inheritance of molecules from the preceding evolutionary stages of the star formation process. In this review we present our current understanding of the chemical processes active in pre- and protostellar environments that set the initial conditions for disks, and the disk chemical processes that evolve the chemical conditions during the first million years of planet formation. We review recent observational, laboratory and theoretical discoveries that have led to the present view of the chemical environment within which planets form, and their effects on the compositions of nascent planetary systems. We also discuss the many unknowns that remain and outline some possible pathways to addressing them.},

We focus on three zones from both observational and theoretical perspectives: (1) the planet forming midplane and ice/vapor transition zones (snow-lines), (2) the warm disk surface that is shielded from radiation, which can be readily accessed by todays observational facilities, and (3) the surface photodissociation layers where stellar radiation dominates. We end with a discussion of how chemistry inﬂuences planet formation along with how to probe the link between formation and ultimate atmospheric composition for gas giants and terrestrial worlds.},

	abstract = {Cosmic rays ({CRs}) are thought to provide an important source of ionization in the outermost and densest regions of protoplanetary disks; however, it is unknown to what degree they are physically present. As is observed in the solar system, stellar winds can inhibit the propagation of {CRs} within the circumstellar environment and subsequently into the disk. In this work, we explore the hitherto neglected effects of {CR} modulation by both stellar winds and magnetic ﬁeld structures and study how these processes act to reduce disk ionization rates. We construct a two-dimensional protoplanetary disk model of a T-Tauri star system, focusing on ionization from stellar and interstellar {FUV}, stellar X-ray photons, and {CRs}. We show that stellar winds can power a heliosphere-like analog, i.e., a “T-Tauriosphere,” diminishing {CR} ionization rates by several orders of magnitude at low to moderate {CR} energies ({ECR} 1 {GeV}). We explore models of both the observed solar wind {CR} modulation and a highly simpliﬁed estimate for “elevated” {CR} modulation as would be expected from a young T-Tauri star. In the former (solar analog) case, we estimate the ionization rate from galactic {CRs} to be ζ{CR} ∼ (0.23–1.4) × 10−18 s−1. This range of values, which we consider to be the maximum {CR} ionization rate for the disk, is more than an order of magnitude lower than what is generally assumed in current models for disk chemistry and physics. In the latter elevated case, i.e., for a “T-Tauriosphere,” the ionization rate by {CRs} is ζ{CR} 10−20 s−1, which is 1000 times smaller than the interstellar value. We discuss the implications of a diminished {CR} ionization rate on the gas physics by estimating the size of the resulting magnetorotational instability dead zones. Indeed, if winds are as efﬁcient at {CR} modulation as predicted here, short-lived radionuclides (now extinct) would have provided the major source of ionization (ζ{RN} ∼ 7.3 × 10−19 s−1) in the planet-forming zone of the young solar nebula.},

	abstract = {The evolution of discs under the action of viscosity is studied by both similarity solutions and Green's functions. The angular momentum is steadily concentrated onto a small fraction of the mass which orbits at greater and greater radii while the rest is accreted onto the central body.We assume that the angular momentum excess of a proto-star is initially concentrated onto one-third of the total mass which forms a disc orbiting the new-born star. Viscous dissipation in this disc will cause it to shine with a luminosity greater than the final main sequence star for a period of 105 yr or so. Most of the properties of T Tauri stars can be explained as a consequence of disc evolution. Flares in Flare stars are interpreted as the entry of blobs of an old disc into the late type stellar atmospheres. On this hypothesis flaring activity could be observed in M stars of up to 5 × 108 yr old, and planetary systems will be common. Disc solutions appropriate to dwarf novae and X-ray sources are also given.},
