Studying chemical evolution of protoplanetary disks has been one of the 
primary ways to understand planetary formation processes. It has multi-faceted effects
on the evolution of disks into a planetary systems as it affects processes like pebble
accretion and influences disk structure and dynamics by regulating distributions of dust and gas in the disks. All of these processes ultimately have major implications as this chemical make-up will eventually provide the raw materials for all kinds of planets: from rocky worlds to gas giants. This work delves on the both modeling and observational aspects of disk chemistry and how it can help us build theories of planet formation.
